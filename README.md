# GeckotechFrontendAssessment

Time spent

Initial setup and planning, reviewing requirements and bootstrapping the workspace with app and lib - 1 hour 15 mins (11:45 - 12:30)
Creating shared components and logic to load and display the list of breweries - 3 hours (12:30 - 15:30)
Break - 45 mins (15:30 - 16:15)
Implementing the remaining functionality and the modal - 2 hours 15 mins (16:15 - 18:30) Note: attempted to implement reusable modal with content projection for headr body and footer but encountered issues and had to revert/redo

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.9.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Code Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent code formatting. The configuration ensures proper spacing in ES imports (spaces between curly braces) and enforces consistent code style.

### Prettier Configuration

The main formatting rules include:
- Single quotes for strings
- Spaces between curly braces in imports
- 100 character line width
- 2 space indentation
- Trailing commas in multi-line structures

To format all files in the project:

```bash
npm run format
```

To check if files are properly formatted without making changes:

```bash
npm run format:check
```
